What is sdees?
--------------

*sdees* is for *distributed* *editing* of *encrypted* *stuff.*

But, really, *sdees* is just a fancy wrapper for ``git`` that
allows you to make time-stamped entries to encrypted documents while
keeping the entire document synchronized. *sdees* is great for a
*distributed and encrypted* journal and is compatible any local repo or
hosted service (Gitlab/Bitbucket/Github).

Why sdees?
--------------

**Problem:** I would like to write into a document (e.g., a journal with
time stamped entries) and also have it be available on all computers I
use, and I want it to be locally encrypted. Unfortunately, typical cloud
storage synchronization utilities (e.g. Dropbox) do not play well with
syncing a single document that is encrypted locally.

**Solution:** The basic solution is to create a lot of files - each
encrypted - where each file contains the text for one entry in the
document. You donâ€™t need any special tool for this - you can just use a
text editor, ``gpg``, and synchronization software like ``git`` or
Dropbox.

My program, *sdees*, just makes this solution easier to attain.
*sdees* comes as a single executable file with the text-editor and
``gpg`` bulit-in - the only system requirement is the installation of
``git`` (which is pretty easy to get on any system). The other benefit
of *sdees* is that it will automatically combine all the time-stamped
entries so it appears that you are editing a single document, and it
will also resolve merges that can occur if you edit the same entry
offline on two computers.

Features
--------

-  *Only one* dependency: ``git`` (version 2.5+)
-  Cross-compatibility (Windows/Linux/OS X).
-  Built-in encryption, compatible with ``gpg``.
-  Built-in text editor, ``micro`` (but options for
   ``emacs``/``vim``/``nano``).
-  Built-in version control (all versions are saved, currently only
   newest is shown).
-  Encrypted filenamesmostly.
-  Searching, summarizing, synchronized deletion, self-updating,
   collision management, and more.
