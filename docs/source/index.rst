What is sdees?
--------------

*sdees* is for *distributed* *editing* of *encrypted* *stuff.*

But, really, *sdees* is just a fancy wrapper for ``git`` that
allows you to make time-stamped entries to encrypted documents while
keeping the entire document synchronized. *sdees* is great for a
*distributed and encrypted* journal and is compatible any local repo or
hosted service (Gitlab/Bitbucket/Github).

-  *Only one* dependency: ``git`` (version 2.5+)
-  Cross-compatibility (Windows/Linux/OS X).
-  Built-in encryption, compatible with ``gpg``.
-  Built-in text editor, ``micro`` (but options for
   ``emacs``/``vim``/``nano``).
-  Built-in version control (all versions are saved, currently only
   newest is shown).
-  Encrypted filenamesmostly.
-  Searching, summarizing, synchronized deletion, self-updating,
   collision management, and more.
