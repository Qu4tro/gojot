Installation Guide
==================

Requirements
----------------

Before you install *sdees* make sure you have the following requirement:

* **git** (version 2.5+)
    *git* can be downloaded for free



.. note::

    To determine branches that are ahead/behind, this program uses ``git for-each-ref`` with the ``push:track`` option, which is not introduced until `version 2.5.0, released March, 2016`_. The alternative to this is ``git branch -vv`` but that is not considered stable.
