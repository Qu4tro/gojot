*gojot* is a modern command-line journal that is distributed and encrypted by default.

Ok. But, really, *gojot* is just a fancy wrapper for `git` that allows you to make time-stamped entries to encrypted documents while keeping the entire document synchronized. *gojot* is great for a *distributed and encrypted* journal and is compatible with all major operating systems. *gojot* is a single binary (with a text-editor built-in!), so you only need `git` to get started.

More info can be found in [the documentation](https://gojot.schollz.com/).

## Install

```
pip install gojot
```

Make sure you also have `gpg` and `git` installed:

```
sudo apt-get install gpg git
```
